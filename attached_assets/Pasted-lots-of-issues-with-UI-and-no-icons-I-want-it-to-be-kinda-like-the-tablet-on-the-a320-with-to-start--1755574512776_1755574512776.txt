lots of issues with UI and no icons I want it to be kinda like the tablet on the a320 with to start a screen showing all flights in ATC 24 following these web sockets then once you select one there is a really cool animation then it loads and stuff add lots of features here is the references: # 24data API
24data is an API that lets third party applications get near real-time information about the aircraft and controllers online in ATC 24.

If you intend on deploying a web-app, all routes should be polled/connected to by your server, as web-browsers will not permit 3rd party clients from making cross origin requests due to our Allow-Origin header. Your server can then serve it to your clients via SSE; WSS; polling our API, caching the data, and serving that to downstream clients; (etc.). However, your server should not just be a simply proxy for your clients, otherwise you'll run into rate limits with more than 3 downstream clients.

Host: https://24data.ptfs.app.

REST Routes:
GET /acft-data
Rate limit: 75 requests per minute. 3rd party servers should poll at 20 requests per minute (every 3 seconds).
Returns AircraftData for all piloted aircraft in the ATC 24 private server.

GET /acft-data/event
Rate limit: Shares rate limit with /acft-data. Polling both acft-data routes at the suggested rate will use 40 requests per minute.
Returns AircraftData for all piloted aircraft in the ATC 24 event server.

GET /controllers
Rate limit: 45 requests per minute. 3rd party servers should poll at 10 requests per minute (every 6 seconds).
Returns Position[].

WebSocket:
Instead of short-polling, your server can get information from 24data live by opening a connection to our WebSocket.
A maximum of 3 connections can be made to the WebSocket. Your server should only need one.
Make sure your Origin header is not set, or is empty when requesting from your server. Browsers will always set the Origin header, and can't be used to connect to this WebSocket.

wss://24data.ptfs.app/wss

You should receive a stream of data in this format:

{
  "t": "EVENT_TYPE",
  "d": "any" // Object or Array. See `Event Types` section below for corresponding data types.
}
Event Types
"ACFT_DATA": AircraftData from the ATC 24 main server.
"EVENT_ACFT_DATA": AircraftData from the ATC 24 event server.
"FLIGHT_PLAN": Stream of submitted **FlightPlan**s for the ATC 24 main server.
"EVENT_FLIGHT_PLAN": Stream of submitted **FlightPlan**s for the ATC 24 event server.
"CONTROLLERS": Position[] i claimed in p#online-atc
